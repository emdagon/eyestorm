## Summary

The main idea of eyestorm is to "complement" Tornado for building applications really fast.

It's a module within a set of classes and decorators that will (supposedly) help you deal with usual Tornado dev situations. It was born while working with MongoDB, so there are some classes that depend on asyncmongo.
