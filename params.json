{"name":"eyestorm","body":"### Eyestorm\r\nThe main idea of eyestorm is to \"_complement_\" [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)[[gh](https://github.com/facebook/tornado)] for building applications really fast.\r\n\r\nIt's a module within a set of classes and decorators that will (supposedly) help you deal with usual Tornado dev situations.  It was born while working with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), so there are some classes that depend on [asyncmongo](https://github.com/bitly/asyncmongo).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThere will be docs... I promise!\r\nIn the meantime; emdagon@gmail.com\r\n\r\n!","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
